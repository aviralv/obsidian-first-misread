# First Misread

Stress-test your writing with synthetic reader personas. Find the first place your draft gets misunderstood — before a real reader does.

First Misread is an Obsidian plugin that runs your active note through a panel of AI-simulated readers, each with different reading behaviors (skimming, skepticism, emotional response, etc.). It surfaces the exact passage where each persona gets confused, loses interest, or misinterprets your intent.

This is not a writing assistant or grammar checker. It's a diverse synthetic audience that finds your blind spots.

## What it does

- **Analyzes your active note** against multiple reader personas in parallel
- **Shows where each persona stopped** — the specific passage and why
- **Click any finding** to jump to and highlight the passage in your note
- **Tracks revision history** — re-analyze after edits to see what improved
- **Optionally generates rewrites** for flagged passages

## Personas

Personas define *how* a simulated reader approaches your text. Each has a reading behavior, focus areas, and conditions that make them stop.

**Core personas** (always run):

| Persona | What they test |
|---------|---------------|
| The Skimmer | Do headings and bold text carry the message alone? |
| The Scanner | Can someone find the key point in 15 seconds? |
| The Busy Reader | Does the opening earn enough interest to keep reading? |
| The Hook Judge | Does the first line work? |
| The Challenger | Are claims backed up? |
| The Voice Editor | Is the voice consistent and distinctive? |
| Sensitivity Scanner | Anything that could land badly out of context? |

**Dynamic personas** (selected per-analysis based on content):

The Skeptic, Literal Reader, Domain Outsider, Emotional Reader, Scope Cop, Mirror Seeker, Cringe Detector, Visualizer, Arc Reader.

**Custom personas**: Drop a YAML file in `personas/custom/` to define your own.
